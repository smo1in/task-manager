SQL task
Given tables:
★ tasks (id, name, status, project_id)

★ projects (id, name)

Write the queries for:
get all statuses, not repeteating, alphabetically ordered
SELECT DISTINCT `status`
FROM `tasks`
ORDER BY `status` ASC
get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
SELECT `project_id`, COUNT(`id`) `count_of_tasks` 
FROM `tasks` 
GROUP BY `project_id` 
ORDER BY `count_of_tasks` DESC
get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
SELECT `p`.`name`, COUNT(`t`.`id`) `count_of_tasks` 
FROM `projects` `p`
INNER JOIN `tasks` `t` ON `p`.`id` = `t`.`project_id`
GROUP BY `t`.`project_id`
ORDER BY `p`.`name` ASC
get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with "N" letter
SELECT *
FROM `tasks`
WHERE `name` LIKE 'N%'
get the list of all projects containing the 'a' letter in the middle of the name, and show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL
SELECT `p`.*, COUNT(`t`.`id`) `count_of_tasks` 
FROM `projects` `p`
INNER JOIN `tasks` `t` ON `p`.`id` = `t`.`project_id`
WHERE `t`.`name` LIKE '%a%'
GROUP BY `t`.`project_id`
get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
SELECT * 
FROM `tasks`  
INNER JOIN(
    SELECT `name`  
    FROM `tasks`  
    GROUP BY `name`  
    HAVING COUNT(`name`) > 1  
) `temp` ON `tasks`.`name` = `temp`.`name`
ORDER BY `tasks`.`name` ASC
get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the project 'Garage'. Order by matches count
SELECT `t`.`name`, `t`.`status`, COUNT(`t`.`name`) `c`
FROM `tasks` `t`
INNER JOIN `projects` `p` ON `t`.`project_id` = `p`.`id`
INNER JOIN (
	SELECT CONCAT(`name`, `status`) `ns`
    FROM `tasks`
    GROUP BY `ns`
    HAVING COUNT(`ns`) > 1
) `temp` ON CONCAT(`t`.`name`, `t`.status) = `temp`.`ns`
WHERE `p`.`name` = 'Garage'
GROUP BY `t`.`name`, `t`.`status`
ORDER BY `c` ASC
get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status 'completed'. Order by project_id
SELECT `p`.`name`
FROM `projects` `p`
INNER JOIN (
	SELECT `project_id`
    FROM `tasks`
    GROUP BY `project_id`
    WHERE `status` = 'completed'
    HAVING COUNT(`id`) > 10
) `t` ON `t`.`project_id` = `p`.`id`
ORDER BY `p`.`id` ASC
